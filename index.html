    <p id="movecolored"> Chocolate is a preparation of roasted and ground cacao seeds that is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in
        a block, which may also be used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods. The earliest signs of use are
        associated with Olmec sites (within what would become Mexicoâ€™s post-colonial territory) suggesting consumption
        of chocolate beverages, dating from the 19th century BC.[1][2] The majority of Mesoamerican people made
        chocolate beverages, including the Maya and Aztecs.</p>

    <p>Chocolate is one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and many foodstuffs involving chocolate
        exist, particularly desserts, including cakes, pudding, mousse, chocolate brownies, and chocolate chip cookies.
        Many candies are filled with or coated with sweetened chocolate. Chocolate bars, either made of solid chocolate
        or other ingredients coated in chocolate, are eaten as snacks. Gifts of chocolate molded into different shapes
        (such as eggs, hearts, coins) are traditional on certain Western holidays, including Christmas, Easter,
        Valentine's Day, and Hanukkah. Chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages, such as chocolate milk and hot
        chocolate, and in some alcoholic drinks, such as creme de cacao.</p>
